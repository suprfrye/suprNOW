          <h2>Charlotte, NC</h2>
          <p>I found this bit of story started in 2012. I don't remember where it was headed. Ideas on finishing this one?</p>
          <p>"I'm going to find you and fucking kill you." These words rang in her head as she walked through the airport, strange faces blurring past. Words that had haunted her for years. She had never dared to come to a place so open and so public. Her worst fear was that one of these faces would look familiar. And that ache in the pit of her stomach and the knot at the base of her throat, the reaction of the body to distress, would return. Some days she had hoped it would come true. When the anxiety got too heavy and the precautions became too much, she would turn the corner quickly and brace for the strike. It would be a hard hit to stun her and remind her who was in control, all of her will escaped in that single blow. On days like this she was the bravest or the most foolish. She let herself wander close to familiar streets and old habits. How else would she be found?</p>
